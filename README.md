## Advanced Calculator in Python

This program is a powerful command-line calculator that offers a variety of features beyond basic arithmetic operations.

### Key Features

* **Basic Arithmetic:** Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and modulo.
* **Unary Operations:** Supports square root and negation for single-value calculations.
* **History Tracking:** Maintains a record of past calculations for reference.
* **Memory Functions:** Allows storing, recalling, and clearing values in memory (M+, M-, MR, MC).
* **User-Friendly Menu:** Provides a clear menu for selecting operations and memory functions.

### How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Select an option from the menu:
    * **1. Perform calculation:** Choose this option to perform various calculations.
    * **2. Display history:** View the history of past calculations.
    * **3. Memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC):** Manage values stored in memory.
    * **4. Exit:** Exit the calculator program.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter values and select operations.

### Example Usage

**Performing a Calculation:**

```
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /, **, %, sqrt, -): +
Enter the first value: 5.2
Enter the second value: 3.8
Result: 9.0
```

**Accessing History:**

```
2. Display history
History of calculations:
1. 5.2 + 3.8 = 9.0
```

**Using Memory Functions:**

```
3. Memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC): 
Enter memory function (M+, M-, MR, MC): M+
Enter value to add to memory: 10.5
3. Memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC): 
Enter memory function (M+, M-, MR, MC): MR
Memory value: 10.5
```

### Notes

* The program can handle decimal numbers.
* Division by zero and invalid operations will result in error messages.
* The history and memory features enhance the calculator's usability for complex calculations.

### Additional Information

This code demonstrates the power of adding features to a basic calculator. You can further extend it with functionalities like:

* More mathematical functions (trigonometry, logarithms)
* Order of operations handling (PEMDAS)
* Graphical user interface (GUI) for a more intuitive experience
